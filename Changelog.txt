Red & poly's update
CLUSTER BOMBS
	-optical fused cluster bombs now under fuses
NEW KORNET MISSILE
	-long range, high speed heavy antitank missile
	-powerful warhead, 650mm pen and large diameter
	-heavier than ataka, but not quite as quick (similar to hellfire but with more speed/range instead of maneuverability)
	-as a stopgap uses an unused but incorrect in-flight model (waiting on a fix for flight model)
ATAKA CHANGES
	-less maneuverability
	-very slightly more speed
	-more reliable performance due to physics model changes
	-reduced penetration slightly to compensate
AT-2 CHANGES
	-slightly increased thrust
	-slight warhead increase in pen
TOW CHANGES
	-slightly buffed speed
RADAR CHANGES
	-Radars are now able to be parented directly to what they are welded to
RACK CHANGES
	-Racks now (hopefully) weldparentable
AAM CHANGES
	-Increased Phoenix speed a bit, to make it slightly more practical
BOMB CHANGES
	-readded HEAT to bombs, removed APHE (lol wtf why was it there?)
MISC CHANGES
	-fixed some fuses that made no sense
	-added optical fuse to a few dumbfire things
	-reworked some fuses to not use getallfusenames because they'd get cluster fuse too (cluster SAMs is a very bad idea!)
