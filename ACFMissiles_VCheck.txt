This is a marker file for the inbuilt version checker.

In the past, when you joined a server running ACF Missiles, you'd get a version notification almost all the time.

This file exists to ensure that the check is performed only if you've installed this mod.

This doesn't mean the checker will be accurate for your personal install as the server may override your files with its own while you're connected.

If you see a version checker warning, tell an admin so they can keep the server up to date!
